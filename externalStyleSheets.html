<h1>External Style Sheets</h1>

<p>This page is styled using an external style sheet. External style sheets allow you to set a style guide and apply it to many web pages. This is great for efficiency and makes your life exponentially easier if you have to change something. To use an external style sheet, open a new file and save it as a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file. In this file just type the rules and properties to change like you would within "style" tags (but don't type the style tags). Then on your HTML document, go to the "head" section and type the following: <b> < link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="yourFileName.css" /> </b>. This will then style your page according to the external style sheet</p>

<p>Note that is also possible to override the external style sheet for just this web page, This is done by adding the style tags and styling an element as you would normally before learning about external style sheets. The reason this works, is because CSS chooses which style to use, by using the most recent style (the one furthest towards the bottom of the "head" section). It is conventional to put the "link" tag for the External Style Sheet at the top of the "head" section, and then the "style" section below it. This ensures that the specifications within the "style" tags overrides the specifications in the external style sheet (if there are any).</p>
