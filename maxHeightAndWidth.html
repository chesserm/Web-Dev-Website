<h2>Max Width and Height</h2>
<p>You can use CSS to set the max width and height of an element. This is most commonly used to restrict picture sizes to make everything look more uniform. An example of this is eBay, where people upload tons of pictures of their item in a ton of different sized images. By setting the max possible size, its more uniform and easier to view. This will also keep the same aspect ratio, and won't mess up the image 99% of the time. To do this, type the following in the "style" tags: <b> img {max-height:200px; max-width:200px;}</b>. This will be demonstrated below.</p>
