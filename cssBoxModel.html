<!-- There are four parts to an html element. The content, padding, border, margin. -->

<!-- Padding is the area between the text and border. The margin is the space outside the border. -->
<!-- Padding can be adjusted using padding-left,right,top,bottom or just padding: for all at once -->

<!-- Border has three properties: color, width, and style. Width takes pixels as a value, and style has several values such as
	 dotted, double, dashed, solid, etc. 
	 Also, border-top-color,style,width will only change the top border. This can be done for all four sides:top, bottom, left, right. -->
<!-- Margins are the space around (outside) the border between elements. It can be changed individually such as margin-top, bottom, left, right 
	 or all at once by editing the margin: property.-->
