<h2>Email links</h2>
<p> This page simply demonstrates how to open a user's default mail program from an html link. This can be useful, but only should be used sparingly. <br />
	To accomplish this in html set the href value in the anchor tag to "mailto:" followed by the email address (i.e. mailto:sarahj@gmail.com).

	<a href="mailto:">Send an email to Matthew.</a>
	<p>NOTE: this is not actually connected to my email for obvious reasons.<p/>
