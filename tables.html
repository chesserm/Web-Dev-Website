<h2>Tables</h2>
<p> This page demonstrates the use of tables in html. The "table" tags are used to declare the table. The "tr" tags are used to declare rows. <br />
	Within "tr" tags, "th" tags are used to create a header (header tags, "h1" through "h6" can be used within "th" tags). The "colspan" property can </br>
	be added to a "th" opening tag to indicate the number of columns you want this cell to span. This is useful for large title cells such as <br />
	in table 2. More obviously, to enter data the "td" tag is used within a "tr" tag to enter table data. This can be any type of data you'd like. <br />
	There are additional properties of tables that can be specified within the opening "table" tag. The "border" property sets a border around each <br />
	cell and the table as a whole. The value to place inside of the "" indicates pixel size of the border (1 is usually sufficient). <br />
	The "width" property specifies how much horizontal space you want the table to consume on the web page. You can enter a blank number into the "" <br />
	to indicate pixels or a percentage (i.e. 100%) which will specify percentage of the screen. The "cellpadding" property gives a specified number <br />
	of pixels between the value in each cell and its cell border. The "cellspacing" property gives space between each cell. Both of these properties <br />
	are demonstrated in the third table.
