Web Development Tutorial Website

by: Matthew Chesser (Github: chesserm)


This project is a way for me to practice my web development knowledge and skills as I use them. I hope to display the information in an informative way that can almost act as a guide for websites. 


My current knowledge is extremely basic, but I'm committed to learning web development tools from the ground up. This will give me a better understanding of how websites work from the inside out. I hope to present my knowledge in this website in a way that others can benefit from it as well.


Current version:


This is the first push of these files. Many of the web pages have little or no explanation. This is because the tutorial informaiton/explanation that I hope to convey through the website eventually, are hidden inside of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS comments. I will work to translate this into actually visible content to make it easier for others to learn this material as well. In the mean time, I strongly recommend vising Bucky Robert's YouTube channel: thenewboston. He provides excellent tutorials in all areas of computer science and his tutorials are always one of the major resources I use when learning new topics, and he is an inspiration to my drive to help disseminate computer science information to others.
