<!-- Using classes to style -->

<h2>Styling Using Classes</h2>
<p class="blueText">Classes are exceptionally important in HTML and CSS. They allow you to declare an element, such as a paragraph as part of a class. This paragraph will then behave according to the CSS styling indicated by that class. For example, this paragraph text outlining the basics of the topic is in the color blue. While the instructions on how to actually accomplish this are in green.</p>

<p class="greenText">To accomplish this, in the "style" tags of the "head" section of your HTML document, write a period (".") followed by whatever name you'd like for that class. So, for example, to change this text to green, the following code can be found in the "style" tags: <b>.greenText {color:green;}</b> The names of classes can be anything you'd like. Now, for the changes to actually take effect, go to the element you'd like to affect and within the opening tag (in this case a paragraph) set the class attribute to the class name from above (without the period). For example, <b>class="greenText"</b> </p>

<p><a href="index.html" title="Home Page">Home</a></p>
