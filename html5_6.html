	<h2>New CSS3 Selectors</h2>
	<hr />
	<p>The following are common CSS3 selectors illustrated with a basic example:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>div > p</b> the greater than sign ("<b>></b>") affects the paragraphs that are children of a div element. Only works with a direct parent, NOT a grandparent.</li>
		<li><b>p.bucky + p</b> the plus sign ("<b>+</b>") only affects the paragraphs that immediately follow a paragraph of class "bucky." They both MUST share the same parent. </li>
		<li><b>p.bucky ~ p</b> the tilde ("<b>~</b>") affects the paragraphs that follow a paragraph of class "bucky," but does NOT need to immediately follow the "bucky" paragraph.</li>
	</ul>
