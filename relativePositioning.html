<h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
<p>Relative positioning moves relatively based on where the element would have normally been placed. Absolutely sets its 0,0 coordinate at the top left of the screen, but relative positioning sets this origin at the point it would normally be set without any change in its style. </p>
