<h1>CSS Basics</h1>
	<p> 
		This page practices the basics of CSS as demonstrated by Bucky Roberts on his "thenewboston" YouTube channel. To use CSS on a web page, 
		the style tags must be used within the head tags of the html. Inside the opening style tag, the "type" attribute must be set to "text/css".
		Within the style tags CSS can modify everything on a webpage by affecting different elements. So if you wanted to make all of the paragraph
		text blue, this could be accomplished. To actually do this type "p {color:blue;}" this uses p as a selector, color as the property, and blue 
		as the value. This can be applied to any element such as headers, unordered lists, ordered lists, and even the body. Note that color can also
		take hexademical values such as #330000. Hexadecimal values require a "#" followed by the 6 digit value. I believe RGB can be used as well, but
		this was not demonstrated in the tutorials. Note that there are thousands of properties to change via CSS. You can change color of text, background
		color of the body, italicize and bold text, change text alignment, font, line height, etc. Additionally, images can be added as the background of the body.
		This is done by changing the background-image property to "url(imageFileName.jpg)". If you don't want the image to repeat, change the "background-repeat" property
		to "no-repeat;". Changing this property to repeat-x or repeat-y will make the picture repeat along the horizontal or vertical axes. If you keep "no-repeat" on, you 
		can use the background-position property to change the picture location. This property takes percentage and pixel values for orientation.
